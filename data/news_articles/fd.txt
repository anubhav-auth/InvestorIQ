The electric vehicle (EV) market is facing a paradigm shift. While early adoption was driven by environmental concerns, recent consumer behavior indicates a stronger emphasis on total cost of ownership and technological features. Companies are now competing on battery range, charging speed, and in-car software. Pricing strategies are also evolving; some brands are introducing more affordable models to capture market share, while others are focusing on premium features to justify higher price points. The next 3-5 years will be critical in determining which companies can scale production to meet demand while managing battery supply chain complexities.

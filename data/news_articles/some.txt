Nvidia's strategic focus has heavily shifted towards dominating the AI and data center markets. Recent earnings calls highlighted record-breaking revenue from their data center division, largely fueled by the demand for their H100 and A100 GPUs. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that "the AI revolution is in full swing," and Nvidia is positioned as the primary engine for this transformation. This strategic pivot has resulted in a significant increase in their stock price over the last year, despite broader market volatility and concerns about the semiconductor shortage, which they have managed to navigate better than competitors by securing their supply chain.
